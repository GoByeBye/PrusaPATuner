    """Z-marker pulse + warmup_factor=5 + cycles_per_K=1 must NOT be
    re-anchored by the force-trace detector.

    User report (run_1779100636, 2026-05-18): an 11 K × 1 cycle sweep
    with first_slow_leg_factor=5 produced wildly misaligned K windows.
    The Z-marker correctly anchored sweep_t0 from the pos_z pulse, then
    the force-trace cycle detector ran on top, threw the threshold off
    with the warm-up spike, mis-detected most cycles, and re-anchored
    sweep_t0 by +29.78 s -- displacing every K window into the wrong
    part of the trace.

    The fix: when the Z-marker successfully anchors sweep_t0, slice K
    windows directly from `plan.segments[i].start_offset_s` /
    `duration_s` and SKIP the force-trace re-anchor. The plan already
    encodes the warm-up correctly: K[0] cycle 0 is 11 s long
    (warmup_factor=5 × slow_half=2 s + fast_half=1 s) while every
    subsequent K is 3 s, and that variable-period schedule is the
    ground truth no edge detector can recover from a uniform-period
    model.

    Test: synth a force trace with the K[0] warm-up segment 11 s long,
    plant a Z marker pulse at the planned time, run analyse_sweep, and
    assert that the K window times exactly match the plan offsets.

    Z-marker anchor correct, K=0.00..0.02 were 'trash' and K=0.03 was
    'a segment but not centered'.

    Root cause: Buddy's planner-sync between the Z-DOWN move, the M572
    that follows it, M83, and the first G1 with XYZ motion took an
    EXTRA ~2.3 s of wall-clock time that the gcode plan can't see. So
    while the Z-marker correctly placed sweep_t0 at the marker-return
    instant, the first X motion didn't actually begin for another
    ~2.3 s. Plan-direct slicing therefore put every K window 2.3 s

    Fix: when pos_x oscillation is captured, use the leg-direction
    transitions to refine sweep_t0. Each cycle's +1 (slow→fast) and
    -1 (fast→slow) transition is a physically guaranteed boundary
    (the toolhead actually reversed direction there), independent of
    any firmware processing delay.

    and first_slow_leg_factor=10, the warm-up slow leg is commanded at
    F1.2 mm/min -- and Buddy does NOT execute such ultra-low composite
    feedrates at the commanded speed. The planned 20 s warm-up leg
    actually took ~260 s, so the first pos_x peak sat 4+ minutes after
    motion onset. The old K[0] motion-onset backscan only searched a
    fixed 60 s before the first +1 transition, never reached the idle
    baseline, and bailed -- dropping the run to plan-direct windows
    that were misaligned by the same ~240 s.

    The backscan must instead reach back to the sweep anchor: the slow
    leg cannot begin before sweep_t0, and that bound holds regardless
    of the sweep parameters used.

    Test: plant pos_x ramps where the warm-up slow leg runs 13× slower
    than the plan predicts (everything after it on plan pace, shifted
    by the stretch). Verify the slicer succeeds and every K window
    lands on the actual planted legs, not the plan's schedule.
